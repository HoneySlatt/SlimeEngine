# Plan

This file says what is being worked on now. It lists the milestones of the current stage, their
status, how each one is checked, and the known debt. Direction beyond this stage is in
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md); decisions are in [`adr/`](adr/README.md). A *stage* is a step of the
roadmap; a *milestone* is a small, verifiable step of a stage.

Every milestone ends with the definition of done in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md#definition-of-done):
build, tests, clippy, rustfmt and rustdoc pass, the program was actually run, and the affected
documentation was updated and reread. From Stage 2 on, every milestone is also checked on Windows
([ADR-0014](adr/0014-amend-roadmap-for-stage-2-and-windows.md)).

## Current

- Stage 3c — A first game: done on 2026-10-15. *Nightwatch* is played to its objective and
  restarted, on Linux and on Windows, through the public API only, and the owner decided where each
  of the findings it met goes
  ([ADR-0057](adr/0057-what-the-first-game-asks-of-the-next-stages.md)).
- Next: Stage 3d, anti-aliasing and the shadows of spot lights
  ([ADR-0056](adr/0056-stage-3d-anti-aliasing-and-spot-light-shadows.md)), with the cost of the
  scene pass measured on Direct3D 12 (ADR-0057). Its plan is to be proposed to the owner.

## Status

Stage 3d is not planned yet. Stages 0, 1, 2, 3a, 3b and 3c are done; see
[Completed stages](#completed-stages).

## Releasing

A release is an annotated git tag on a commit whose CI run is green on Linux and Windows
([ADR-0004](adr/0004-workspace-layout-and-crate-naming.md)):

1. In one commit, set the version in the root `Cargo.toml` and the tag that the README's "Using
   SlimeEngine in a game" names, rename the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` to
   `[<version>] - <date>`, and update this plan.
2. Push that commit and wait for its CI run to pass.
3. Tag that commit, not a later one, then push the tag:
   `git tag -a v<version> -m "SlimeEngine <version>" <commit>`.
4. From 0.1 on, create the GitHub release of the tag, its `CHANGELOG.md` section as its notes,
   with the `slime-examples-windows` artifact of that commit's CI run attached as
   `slime-examples-windows-<version>.zip`, holding beside the programs `LICENSE.txt`, a
   `NOTICE.txt` and the licenses of the egui fonts that `scene.exe` embeds, which the Ubuntu Font
   Licence asks to travel with them: CI keeps its artifacts 14 days, a release keeps them.

0.0.1 was released on 2026-10-12, before Windows joined CI: the tag `v0.0.1` is on the commit
"Release 0.0.1". 0.0.2 was released the same way on 2026-10-12: the tag `v0.0.2` is on the
commit "Release 0.0.2", and 0.0.3 on 2026-10-13: the tag `v0.0.3` is on the commit
"Release 0.0.3". 0.1 was released on 2026-10-14: the tag `v0.1.0` is on the commit "Release 0.1.0",
and its GitHub release carries the Windows examples that CI built from that commit.

The details of each completed milestone (what it delivered, how it was checked, what was measured)
are in the history of this file and in the commits that implemented it; the measurements that
justify a decision are also in its ADR.

## Known debt

Limitations known and accepted for now. The ones that a contributor could take on alone are also
GitHub issues, linked from their entry; this list stays the reference.

- **Frames are not synchronized with the display's refresh** (ADR-0021; issue
  [#1](https://github.com/HoneySlatt/SlimeEngine/issues/1)). With Mailbox, the default, the
  schedule alone paces frames: on a 60 Hz display, an image is now and then shown twice while the
  next one is dropped. On a display of 144 or 165 Hz, the default 60 frames a second last 2 or 3
  refreshes in turn, which shows as judder in motion: a game can raise `AppConfig::max_frame_rate`
  to the display's rate, which the engine does not report, or choose `PresentMode::Fifo`, which
  shows one image per refresh but can stall as the next entry says. Aligning frames on the
  compositor's frame callbacks is to reconsider when a renderer draws real scenes.
- **Without Mailbox, presenting can still stall the loop.** Windows that do not offer it, and
  applications that choose `PresentMode::Fifo`, wait for the display: one frame per second for a
  hidden window on niri. In a headless Weston with lavapipe, `acquire` waits for Weston's frame
  callbacks for a time that depends on the machine's load: 120 frames of the `window` example took
  15 s on 2026-10-12 (release build, waits of 130 ms on average), 9 s and 25 s in other
  measurements the same day, against 2 s with Mailbox.
- **A hidden window keeps drawing** at the scheduled rate (2 to 3 % of one CPU core on the
  development machine): the engine cannot tell on Wayland whether its window is visible. winit
  reports occlusion on X11, which the engine ignores: under a compositing manager, Xwayland
  included, the X server reports windows as visible anyway.
  On Windows, a window covered by another keeps drawing too; a minimized one, of size zero, draws
  nothing (M3b.9).
- **wgpu's errors panic, in release builds too** (ADR-0016): a use of wgpu that it rejects is
  treated as a bug. Before games ship, logging the error and dropping the frame is to be
  considered. Running out of GPU memory is not such a use: creations return
  `GfxError::OutOfMemory`, and memory that runs out where no caller hears of it gives the device up,
  which stops the run (ADR-0044). The engine avoids the rejections that the environment can
  cause: a window larger than the device's largest image is drawn at that size (`Surface::resize`),
  and a shader or pipeline that the driver rejects is returned as an error (`GfxError::Shader` or
  `GfxError::Pipeline` on Direct3D 12; on Vulkan, wgpu treats the driver's failure as a lost
  device, `GfxError::DeviceLost`); a window's surface that the graphics API refuses to configure
  counts as lost (ADR-0025). The refusal of a configuration is not tested: nothing the tests
  control makes a conformant driver refuse one.
- **A lost GPU device is not replaced** (ADR-0022; issue
  [#2](https://github.com/HoneySlatt/SlimeEngine/issues/2)): the run stops with an error, and
  since winit allows one event loop per process, carrying on means starting the process again.
  Recovering from a loss is planned for Stage 4 (ADR-0052).
- **In capture tools, the sky pass shows as a second `scene`.** A pass is named after the target it
  draws into, and the sky pass draws into the scene's high-dynamic-range target, after the scene
  pass (`declare_frame` in `crates/slime-render/src/renderer.rs`); only its pipeline is named `sky`.
  Seen in RenderDoc on Direct3D 12 (M3b.9).
- **Frames pause on Windows while the user moves the window, holds its title bar or a border, or
  opens the system menu**: the system then runs a loop of its own, in which no redraw arrives and
  the engine's loop does not wake, so frames and the check for termination signals pause until it
  ends (ADR-0020; the move was measured in M2.4). Keeping frames going would mean asking for
  redraws from inside each frame and waiting there for the schedule.
- **wgpu-hal logs an error when an adapter cannot present to the window**, even though the engine
  then uses another one: seen with RADV in a headless Weston, where only lavapipe can present.
- **No title text in client-side decorations.** On compositors that do not draw decorations
  (GNOME), the title bar has no text, because winit's text renderer depends on an unmaintained
  crate (ADR-0011).
- **Input not reported yet** (issue [#3](https://github.com/HoneySlatt/SlimeEngine/issues/3)):
  input-method text, touch, touchpad gestures, gamepads, dropped files, the mouse's raw motion.
  The window cannot grab or hide the cursor, go fullscreen, or change its title once created.
- **A compositor that stops answering blocks the engine.** Before the first frame, winit waits for
  the window's first configuration without a timeout, so a termination signal is noticed only when
  a second one ends the process; after `shutdown`, releasing the window or the surface can block
  too (seen with a Weston stopped by SIGSTOP).
- **Logging off or shutting down Windows ends a game without `App::shutdown`.** Windows tells a
  window of it with end-session messages, which winit does not report, and sends no console event
  to a process that has loaded `user32.dll`, as every engine process has
  (`crates/slime-app/src/signal.rs`): what a game saves in `shutdown` is lost then.
- **WARP's shader compiler crashes the process, now and then, when several threads compile
  shaders at once**, even on separate devices: an access violation (`STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION`)
  that other projects trace to `d3d10warp.dll`, and that no test can catch. Seen once in the
  Windows CI job, on 2026-10-13, in the texture tests of
  `slime-gfx`, after about ten green runs; other projects that test on WARP report the same crash,
  and that running the tests one at a time avoids it, which the Windows job does since, and which
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` asks of contributors on WARP. The engine's own code is not involved.
- **Client-side decorations run `dbus-send` twice when the window is created** (winit's
  sctk-adwaita, on compositors that do not draw decorations), each waiting up to 100 ms when the
  settings portal does not answer; the error they log when no session bus or portal answers is
  hidden by the default log filter (ADR-0019).
- **Upgrading wgpu waits for egui** while the engine's tooling draws with it: the dev overlay, and
  from Stage 6 the editor (ADR-0031, ADR-0052). `egui-wgpu` is built against one wgpu version
  (egui 0.36 against wgpu 30 today), so wgpu moves only once egui follows.
- **The dev overlay blends in an sRGB framebuffer.** egui prefers a linear one for its blending,
  warns once at startup, and its panels look slightly lighter than egui's own demos (ADR-0031).
  Harmless for tooling.
- **Mipmaps are computed on the CPU when a texture is created** (`Gpu::create_texture`, whose
  documentation gives the cost), on the calling thread, in work proportional to the texture's pixels
  (ADR-0032): a level of tens of large textures waits seconds. A caller with levels of its own gives
  them to `Gpu::create_texture_with_levels` (ADR-0039). To move to the GPU, or to the asset pipeline
  of Stage 4.
- **Every offscreen render target and depth target can be sampled** (ADR-0033): they all carry the
  usage that allows it, which may cost some compression on some GPUs. Measured at M3b.5 on an RX
  6900 XT (RADV), with two builds that differ only by it: no cost (the scene pass took 43.9 µs
  with it and 44.0 µs without at 1920 × 1080, ADR-0033's correction). Other GPUs are not measured.
- **A pipeline that does not fit its pass, or a target sampled by the pass that draws into it,
  panics only when the commands of its submission are finished** inside `Gpu::submit` (or
  `Gpu::render`, `Gpu::render_depth`), with wgpu's message naming the pass, rather than at the
  faulty call (ADR-0033, ADR-0041). For the renderer's frame, the render graph refuses a pass that
  samples what it draws into before wgpu sees it.
- **On X11, losing the connection to the X server ends the process** with exit status 1, inside
  the X11 library (Xlib). `EventHandler::exiting`, `App::shutdown` and the return of `run` do not
  happen, although ADR-0010 promises that `shutdown` is called once `init` has been. winit
  installs no IO error handler. Installing one (`XSetIOErrorExitHandler`, libX11 1.7 or later)
  would need a new direct dependency such as `x11-dl`. On Wayland, a compositor that dies ends the
  loop cleanly.
- **Without libxkbcommon, the windowing library panics** rather than returning
  `PlatformError::Connect`. On X11 it panics at once, also without libxkbcommon-x11 or without the
  X server's XKB extension. On Wayland it panics when the compositor first reports a keyboard,
  which can be in the middle of a run. Turning it into an error would mean probing the libraries
  before winit does.
- **A termination signal received after `run` has returned no longer ends the process by itself**
  (ADR-0012). `ctrlc` cannot remove the handler that `run` installs. A first signal received then
  only stops later runs, and logs that the run stops after the current frame; only a second one
  ends the process, with exit code 130. This matters for a program that keeps working after
  `run`, for example under a service manager, which waits out its stop timeout. Ending the process
  at once when no run is active would amend ADR-0012.
- **A GPU device lost by a frame's own submission is checked by hand only** (ADR-0022). The
  `device-lost` scenario of `crates/slime-app/tests/windowed_lifecycle.rs` destroys the device in
  the middle of a frame and checks that the run stops: no frame drawn after it, `shutdown` called
  once, and `run` returning `RunError::Gfx(GfxError::DeviceLost)`. The most likely loss in a
  windowed frame is one that a submission of `App::render` finds, between `Surface::acquire` and
  `SurfaceFrame::present`: wgpu 30 then refuses to present the image and keeps it, and on Vulkan,
  dropping the surface at the end of the run panicked in wgpu-hal. `present` now destroys the
  image's texture instead, which releases what wgpu-hal holds for it (it relies on wgpu-core 30's
  `Texture::destroy`, to check again when wgpu is upgraded). This was checked by hand on 2026-10-13
  in a headless Weston with lavapipe, with a temporary hook that destroys the device from
  `App::render`: before the fix the run panicked, after it `run` returns `DeviceLost`. A test cannot
  keep this check: a destroyed device records its loss only in a poll, and that poll releases the
  image itself.
- **A window frame dropped without being presented keeps one of the window's images on Vulkan.**
  wgpu 30 discards such a frame with wgpu-hal's `discard_texture`, which does nothing on Vulkan.
  The image stays acquired until the surface is configured again, and once none is left,
  `Surface::acquire` waits one second and returns `None`. `SurfaceFrame` documents this as a
  misuse, and nothing reports it; the engine always presents. A `Drop` that presents was rejected:
  it would show a black or half-drawn frame instead of skipping it, and present during unwinding.
- **An oversize window's surface is configured again at every frame on X11.** A window wider or
  taller than the device's largest image (8192 pixels with the default limits) gets images of that
  size, smaller than the window. On X11, Mesa's Vulkan drivers mark such a swapchain suboptimal, and
  every image of it too. `Surface::acquire` treats each suboptimal image as a reason to configure
  the surface again, at the same clamped size, so every frame waits for the GPU to finish and
  rebuilds the window's images. The frames are correct, and only `debug` logs show it; Wayland and
  Direct3D 12 are not affected. Not setting `stale` in the `Suboptimal` arm of `Surface::next_image`
  while `oversize` is set is not enough: measured, the `Outdated` branch then configures the surface
  again. Asking the device for the adapter's own largest image (`max_texture_dimension_2d`) instead
  of the default limit would make such windows rare. To measure, before and after: start Xvfb with a
  screen wider than 9000 pixels; with `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` unset, `DISPLAY` set to it and lavapipe, run
  the child of the `oversize` scenario of `crates/slime-app/tests/windowed_lifecycle.rs` with
  `SLIME_LOG=wgpu_core=debug`; count wgpu-core's `configuring surface with` records (about one per
  frame without the fix, one with it) and note the frame times.
- **Termination signals are ignored for the rest of the process when `ctrlc` cannot start its
  thread.** `ctrlc` installs its handlers, then starts the thread that waits for what they catch.
  When that thread cannot start (a limit on threads reached when `run` installs the handler), the
  handlers stay installed and SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Break on Windows) are
  ignored: only SIGKILL, or closing the console on Windows, ends the process. The engine logs a
  warning that says so and gives the system's error. Restoring the default dispositions would need
  a direct dependency on libc or nix.
- **Any `trace` directive in `SLIME_LOG` makes wgpu build its per-command trace records.**
  tracing-subscriber sets the `log` crate's maximum level from the most verbose directive. With
  `slime_app=trace`, wgpu-core then formats and filters out about five records per draw while it
  encodes a pass, which counts in the caller's span (`render` in a windowed run): measured with
  `RenderStats::cpu_time` for a scene of 1000 instances, 0.38 ms more per frame, 35 %, with
  `slime_app=trace` than with `SLIME_LOG` unset. Alternatively, profile with
  `perf record -g` and look for `tracing_log::LogTracer::log`, `EnvFilter::enabled` and
  `wgpu_core::resource::Labeled::error_ident`. Capping the `log` level needs `log` or
  `tracing-log` as a direct dependency (ADR-0006). Span close lines are also written while the
  enclosing span is entered, so `frame`, `render` and, with `slime_gfx=trace`,
  `RenderStats::cpu_time` include them: take timing baselines with `SLIME_LOG` unset.
- **On Windows with Vulkan (`WGPU_BACKEND=vulkan`), an acquire that waits more than one second
  loses the device.** wgpu-hal 30.0.1 waits on a fence after `vkAcquireNextImageKHR` hands out an
  image, on Windows only, and maps a timeout of that wait to `DeviceError::Unexpected`, which
  wgpu-core treats as the loss of the device. A GPU frame longer than about one second, or a
  compositor that holds the window's images that long (a covered window, a locked session), then
  stops the run with `GfxError::DeviceLost`, with a reason that blames the driver; on Linux the
  frame is skipped instead. Not reproduced: in the owner's Windows 11 virtual machine with an AMD
  driver, the `scene` example kept running with its window covered for six seconds and with the
  session locked (2026-10-13). To report to wgpu: that wait's timeout should give
  `SurfaceError::Timeout`, as its other waits do.
- **Seen from below, the sample scene's walls and crates flicker where they touch the floor.** Their
  bottom faces lie in the floor's plane, and since M3b.3 the floor is double-sided, so from below
  both are drawn at the same depth (z-fighting). The `scene` example keeps its camera above the
  floor, but another viewer of the asset sees it. Lifting them by a few millimetres in
  `examples/assets/make_scene.py` fixes it, at the cost of rendering the glTF references again.
- **A mouse button can stay down on Wayland when the compositor takes the pointer away during a
  press without taking the keyboard focus.** winit 0.30 reports only `CursorLeft` then, and
  `Translator` (`crates/slime-platform/src/event.rs`) releases held buttons only when the focus is
  lost. Releasing them on `CursorLeft` would be right on Wayland only: on X11 and Windows the
  cursor leaves the window during an ordinary drag.
- **On Windows, the first of two held Shift keys let go of is released late.** Windows sends a
  single key-up for both Shift keys, so the engine releases the first one only when the second
  goes up. Windows 11 marks the second Shift's press as a repeat, so neither its press nor its
  release is reported (seen in the owner's virtual machine on 2026-10-13). Polling `GetKeyState`,
  as GLFW and SDL do, would remove the delay and report both keys, but needs `windows-sys` as a
  direct dependency.
- **After a dead key, a press and its release report different logical keys.** On Wayland and
  X11, a character key that does not combine with a pending dead key is reported as
  `Key::Unidentified` with no text; when the keys combine, the press is the composed character and
  the release the plain one. winit exposes no better value; rebuilding one would need libxkbcommon
  called directly. Documented in `KeyEvent::logical`.
- **A key pressed just after the window gains the focus can be swallowed on X11 and Windows.**
  winit reads which keys are down when it handles the focus event, not when the focus changed. A
  key pressed in between counts as held before the focus and is not reported until it is pressed
  again; on X11 the gap covers `App::init` when the window manager focuses the window while it
  runs. The translator cannot tell such a press from X11's unmarked first auto-repeat. On Windows,
  trusting `KeyEvent::repeat` would close the gap, at the cost of a rule that differs between
  platforms; left as documented.
- **The examples' glTF loader sets no limit on a file's total memory** (left as it is by the owner's
  decision of 2026-10-13: the loader is temporary). It checks each primitive alone against the GPU's
  largest buffer, reads every primitive of every mesh before placing any, and gives primitives that
  name the same accessors their own copy, three vertices per triangle when they have no normals. A
  valid GLB of a few MiB that lists one primitive many times can make the process run out of memory
  rather than be refused. Budgets for imported assets belong to the importer of Stage 4.
- **No test covers the empty submission of frames without a window image.** When
  `Surface::acquire` gives no image, it submits an empty batch, so that wgpu releases the writes
  an application makes outside `App::render`. Without it, 2000 frames of a surface resized to
  zero, each writing 64 KiB to a uniform buffer, grew the process by about 120 MiB (lavapipe in a
  headless Weston, 2026-10-13), measured by a program kept out of the repository. The
  `draws-nothing` scenario of `crates/slime-app/tests/windowed_lifecycle.rs` checks the same for
  frames whose image nothing draws, not for frames without an image.
- **A GPU time can read 0 once when the timestamp counter wraps.** On adapters whose timestamps
  have 36 valid bits (Intel's Vulkan driver, about once every one to one and a half hours), a
  timed pass that runs across the wrap ends before it starts. `GpuTimer::latest` then gives 0 for
  that pass until the next time replaces it. wgpu does not tell how many bits are valid, so the
  wrapped difference cannot be recovered. Dropping such a sample (`end.checked_sub(start)` in
  `crates/slime-gfx/src/timer.rs`) is a one-line change if it ever matters.
- **The instance buffer is uploaded whole every frame.** `Renderer::render` uploads
  `capacity × stride` bytes (256-byte slots with the default limits), where the capacity is a
  power of two from 64 that fits the frame's instances, up to four times as many: it shrinks back
  once a frame uses a quarter of it or less, so that a 10-instance frame after a 100 000-instance
  one costs what it costs on a new renderer (0.054 ms against 21.4 ms before, on lavapipe).
  Uploading only the live slots would amend ADR-0026's rule that a uniform buffer is always
  written at its creation size.
- **The dev overlay can still panic on a lost device** (ADR-0022). `Overlay::render` skips the
  frame when the device was lost earlier in it, but two cases panic inside egui-wgpu or wgpu: a
  loss that egui-wgpu's own buffer upload is the first to find, and `Overlay::new` on a device
  already lost (egui-wgpu creates its buffers with `create_buffer_init`). Both are documented
  under `# Panics`; closing them needs a change in egui-wgpu or wgpu.
- **The glTF loader copies shared vertex attributes into every primitive that uses them**
  (`examples/common/gltf.rs`). Each primitive that has normals gets every vertex of its position,
  normal and texture-coordinate accessors, including those its indices do not name. K primitives
  that share one set of attributes over V vertices, each with its own indices (three.js writes a
  mesh of several materials this way), therefore upload K × V vertices instead of about V, decode
  the attributes K times and grow the bounds over K × V points. The sample asset does not share
  attributes, and the importer of Stage 4 replaces the loader. The fix is to compact each
  primitive to the vertices its indices name. To measure: load a three.js export of a mesh with
  several materials, and compare the sum of `MeshData::positions.len()` over the meshes created,
  and the load time, before and after.
- **Exposed light beyond 64 × 65 504 is clamped** (ADR-0035, ADR-0037, ADR-0039, ADR-0040). The
  scene and sky shaders write exposed light divided by 64 into the `Rgba16Float` target, and light
  above 64 × 65 504 as 65 504, the largest half, rather than leave it to the driver, which may store
  an infinity that the tone curve turns into NaN; lavapipe and RADV clamp it themselves, so that no
  test can show either clamp. The sun's disc, 1.47 × 10⁹ nits for the sample's sun, is clamped from
  an exposure of 2.85 × 10⁻³, six and a half stops above the sample's; emission above
  64 × 65 504 / exposure, and any light once the exposure is raised about 13.5 stops above the
  sample's, are clamped too, and the bloom spreads them with the energy they keep. A sky's radiance
  is at most 65 504 nits before the exposure: brighter zenith, horizon or ground is refused, and a
  brighter glow kept within it. Divided by 64, exposed light below 64 × 2⁻¹⁴, about 0.004, is
  stored in half precision's subnormals, in steps of 64 × 2⁻²⁴: black on an 8-bit display, whose
  darkest step is about 0.007 exposed; an output of higher precision would show its steps.
- **Every fragment evaluates every light of the scene** (ADR-0037). The scene pass has no light
  culling: its cost grows with the number of lights, about 20 µs per light for a screen of 1920 ×
  1080 fragments on an RX 6900 XT (2026-10-13), 338 µs for 16, the most a scene holds, and 10 to 20
  times more on an integrated GPU; a light's range saves no work. More lights would need clustered
  or tiled culling and a storage buffer, a measured decision of Stage 9a (ADR-0052).
- **Point and spot lights cast no shadows, and light what objects hide** (ADR-0037, ADR-0038: only
  the first directional light that casts shadows casts them). The sample's spot light is aimed up,
  so that the light the wall would stop goes into the sky; its ring light reaches 4 m, and gives
  little beyond a metre. The shadows of spot lights come with Stage 3d (ADR-0056), those of point
  lights with Stage 9a (ADR-0052).
- **Every instance is drawn, with a draw call of its own** (`Renderer`). Nothing leaves out the
  instances that the camera does not see, and instances of the same mesh and material are not
  drawn together: a frame's CPU and GPU time grow with every instance of the scene, wherever it is.
  Frustum culling and instancing are left to Stage 9a (ADR-0052).
- **One shadow map, without cascades** (ADR-0050). It covers what the camera sees up to the light's
  shadow distance, with texels of one size (`DirectionalLight::shadow_distance` gives it): what is
  near the camera gets the texels of what is far, and shadows end at the map's edge, without
  fading. Cascades are left to Stage 9a (ADR-0052). Every renderer holds the map (`Renderer` gives
  its size), even for scenes without a directional light.
- **Shadows shift, and thin objects close to a surface lose theirs (peter-panning)** (ADR-0050).
  The normal offset that keeps surfaces from shadowing themselves looks a point up 3 texels × the
  sine of the light's incidence off its surface: at the default distance, 13 cm under a light 45°
  from the normal, 18 cm at grazing. A shadow shifts by up to that much, and a sheet lying closer
  than that above a floor casts nothing on it.
- **Every draw of the scene pass runs a shader that can discard fragments** (ADR-0035). The `MASK`
  alpha mode discards in the one fragment shader that every material uses, opaque materials with a
  cutoff of 0. Some GPUs then test depth after the shader rather than before, for opaque draws
  too, which costs overdraw. Not measured: compare the scene pass's GPU time on a scene with much
  overdraw against a build whose opaque materials use a fragment entry point without `discard`
  (six pipelines instead of three).
- **Tangents that a glTF file lacks are computed per triangle, not with MikkTSpace** (ADR-0035),
  against which normal textures are usually baked. Such files shade slightly differently from
  other viewers, most at seams in the texture coordinates. The importer of Stage 4 computes
  MikkTSpace tangents.
- **The sky's light is neither shadowed nor occluded** (ADR-0039). A surface under an object, or
  inside a box, receives the whole sky, but for its material's occlusion texture: no ambient
  occlusion (screen-space effects are outside the stage), no reflection probes, and mirrors reflect
  the sky, never the objects around them. An interior is lit by the whole sky through its walls:
  until then, draw it without an environment, or with a sky of lower radiances, and light it with
  point and spot lights. Khronos's Sponza shows it (M3b.9): its arcades are lit by the sky as its
  open courtyard is, in the same blue.
- **Glass is drawn opaque.** The examples' loader ignores glTF's `KHR_materials_transmission` and
  `KHR_materials_volume`, and warns that it does: the renderer neither lets light through a surface
  nor blends one (Khronos's FlightHelmet and ABeautifulGame, M3b.9). Transparency is left to
  Stage 9a (ADR-0052).
- **One GPU, an AMD, and two CPU drivers have run the engine.** The image tests' tolerances
  (ADR-0030), the measurements of this plan and the samples' looks come from an RX 6900 XT, with
  RADV on Linux and AMD's driver on Windows, from lavapipe and from WARP: NVIDIA's and Intel's GPUs
  are untried.
- **The environment is computed on the CPU, in every process that draws a sky** (ADR-0039): 23 ms
  in a release build on the owner's 16 threads, 162 ms on one core, and the BRDF table once (15
  ms); about eight times longer in a debug build, which every test that draws a sky with a gradient
  or a sun pays: the workspace's tests took 23.9 s instead of 9.7 s on lavapipe on the owner's
  machine, most in `slime-render`'s `tests/environment.rs` (6.2 s) and the examples'
  `tests/gltf.rs` (5.7 s), whose every load of a file computes the sample's sky. A sky that changes
  needs a new environment: no time of day. To measure: `cargo test --release -p slime-render --lib
  -- --ignored --nocapture`, against the budget of M3b.6. To move to the asset pipeline of Stage 4,
  or to compute passes if skies change at run time; if the tests' time matters first, building
  `slime-render` optimized in debug builds would shorten it, at the cost of stepping through it in
  a debugger.
- **The sky's sun is described twice** (ADR-0039). A game gives the same `DirectionalLight` to
  `Sky::sun`, for the disc and the glow, and to `Scene::lights`, for its light and its shadows;
  two different lights show a disc where no light comes from. The sample takes both from the
  file's first directional light.
- **Rough metals reflect the sky with multiple scattering compensated, the lights without**
  (ADR-0039, as the Khronos glTF Sample Viewer): a white metal of roughness 1 reflects all of a
  uniform sky, but its lights keep glTF's single-scattering BRDF, under which it would reflect
  31 % of that sky; rough metals are darker in the sun than in the shade, relatively.
- **A roughness between two prefiltered levels reads a blend of their lobes** (ADR-0039): the four
  levels are 0.25 apart, and a lobe in between is approximated by mixing the nearest two, the split
  sum's usual approximation; each level is within 2.2 % of its own lobe's average.
- **The image tests use up to 76 of the 131 pixels that RADV may have off by more than 8**
  (ADR-0030, ADR-0054): the glTF scene's front view 76, on the wall's mortar joints seen at a
  grazing angle; `shapes` 28, on edges and the metal spheres' reflections of the sky (49 at M3b.6,
  before the bloom; 33 before the shadow map followed the camera and the output was dithered). A
  change that adds fine or reflective detail may exceed it; measure it again then.
- **Four passes per submission is a number measured on one machine** (ADR-0041). On the owner's
  RX 6900 XT (RADV), whose memory that the CPU can map is a 256 MiB window, one submission of a
  whole bloomed frame stalled in the kernel once the desktop's programs and a test program filled
  that window to 241 MiB (a mean 2.4 ms, 8 ms in one frame of ten, at 1920 × 1080); submissions of
  2 to 6 passes did not, 8 did. The cause in the kernel is not established; Direct3D 12 and other
  GPUs are not measured, and a GPU with resizable BAR has no such window. To measure: the CPU time
  of `render` at 1920 × 1080 with the sample's bloom, for several values of
  `PASSES_PER_SUBMISSION` in `crates/slime-render/src/graph.rs`, with the window filled to
  several levels, by the desktop's programs or by a program that allocates device-local,
  host-visible memory (on Linux, `mem_info_vis_vram_used` in the GPU's sysfs directory tells how
  full it is).
- **The render graph trusts what a pass says it samples from imported targets** (ADR-0041). The
  groups that sample transient targets are built from the declarations, but the scene pass's group
  holding the shadow map is built with the renderer: a pass that binds an imported target must
  declare it, or the graph orders it without knowing.
- **A renderer whose frame changes shape at every call reports no tone-mapping or bloom time**
  (ADR-0041). Each change of shape (the output's size, the shadow pass or the bloom starting or
  stopping) builds the frame again with new timers, and the last submission's times come back
  during the next call, by then read from newer timers; such a renderer also creates its targets
  again at every call, as it did before. Use one renderer per output size.
- **Tiny, very bright sources blink in the bloom** (ADR-0040). Without a firefly filter (Karis's
  average dims the sun's halo and makes it flicker, measured), a highlight smaller than a pixel
  blooms as its coverage of the pixel changes from frame to frame. Temporal anti-aliasing, or a cap
  on the light a pixel brings to the chain, belong to Stage 9a (ADR-0052).
- **A pixel whose light is not a number spreads through the bloom** (ADR-0040). Materials' values
  are not checked: a NaN in a base color or an emission makes its pixels NaN in the
  high-dynamic-range target, and the bloom averages them into its levels, and from there into
  every pixel within reach of their halo, a blot where one surface was wrong. Checking materials'
  values as lights' are (ADR-0042), or dropping such light before the bloom, would keep it to its
  pixels.
- **The bloom has one shape** (ADR-0040): every level the same weight, down to a side of 8 texels;
  no radius, threshold or tint for a game to set. A window resized across a power of two adds or
  removes a level: the glow's reach changes a little while the edge is dragged.
- **Light near the right and bottom edges blooms a little more or less** (ADR-0040). Where an
  output's side is not a multiple of 2^levels, the coarse levels' last texels straddle the edge: a
  pixel's halo there holds 0.83 to 1.37 of its light at ten sizes measured, up to 1.9 at the far
  corner (1023 × 1023, 2047 × 1151), within 1.011 at 1280 × 720 and about 1.1 at 1920 × 1080; inside
  the image and at the top and left edges, its light exactly. To measure: the CPU model of
  `tests/bloom.rs` at the size in question. A fix would pad the chain beyond those edges.
- **glTF minification filters are approximated.** `slime-gfx` ties mip blending to the
  minification filter and gives every texture mipmaps, so only `NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST` and
  `LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR` are exact (documented in the loader). Revisit when an engine-side user
  needs a separate mipmap filter or a base-level-only read.
## Notes

- CI build cache: not added yet. With wgpu, the Linux job takes about 2.5 minutes and the Windows
  job about 5 (measured on the runs of 2026-10-12; it compiles the dependencies three times: for
  clippy, for the tests, and in release for the artifact), which is acceptable; a cache is to add if
  it grows much further. The dependencies of Stage 3a (glam, gltf, egui) were expected to add to
  it, and each milestone that added one recorded the new duration here. With glam and the render
  crate (M3.2, 2026-10-13): Linux 2 minutes 49 seconds, Windows 4 minutes 59 seconds. With gltf and
  egui (M3.6, 2026-10-13): Linux 3 minutes 22 seconds, Windows 5 minutes 42 seconds, and 6 minutes
  2 seconds once its tests ran one at a time. At the release (M3.7, 2026-10-13), over the ten
  green runs before it: Linux from 2 minutes 35 seconds to 3 minutes 38 seconds, Windows from
  3 minutes 12 seconds to 7 minutes 10 seconds; the Windows runner's speed varies from one run to
  the next more than the code changes between them. At 0.1 (M3b.9, 2026-10-14): Linux 5 minutes 40
  seconds, Windows 11 minutes 32 seconds, of which the tests take 4 minutes 31 seconds and the
  release build of the examples 3 minutes 24 seconds. The owner decided then to keep CI as it is,
  the repository being public and its minutes free, and to reconsider past 20 minutes.
